##Curriculum
###Learning to Code
This is the [curriculum] (https://github.com/drardito/Learning_To_Code) from a five sesion program to teaching coding, and culminating with [Arduino] (http://www.arduino.cc/) projects.

### Scratch>Ardublock>Processing>Arduino> Internet of Things
This is a progression of making and inventing tools created by Jeff Branson, Director of Education for [Sparkfun.com](https://www.sparkfun.com/).
It features free tools with lots of room for growth and complexity.
